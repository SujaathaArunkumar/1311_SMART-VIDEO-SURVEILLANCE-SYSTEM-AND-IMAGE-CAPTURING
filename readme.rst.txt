6. About (Short Description / Summary): 
Video surveillance systems are becoming increasingly important for crime investigation and the number of cameras installed in public space is increasing. However, many cameras installed at fixed positions are required to observe a wide and complex area. In order to efficiently observe such a wide area at lower cost, mobile robots are an attractive option. According to the result of moving object detection research on video sequences, the movement of the people is tracked using video surveillance.
Usual background subtraction approaches often poorly perform on a long traffic video due to gradual changes of illumination and background shadow position. We present a fast and robust background subtraction algorithm based on unified spatio-temporal background and foreground modeling. The correlation between neighboring pixels provides high levels of detection accuracy in the dynamic background scene. Our Bayesian fusion method, which establishes the traffic scene model, combines both background and foreground models and considers prior probabilities to adapt changes of background in each frame. The moving object is identified using the Cauchy distribution model . The Cauchy distribution model will compare the current frame with the previous frame.  The threshold value is calculated to find the moving image. Using  threshold value the detected pixel is identified. Hence the movement of the object is identified accurately. After motion detection it will send GCM alert to the android mobile application.

7. Install (Installation procedure): 
Step 1: InstallJMF(java media frame) 
Step 2:Install Eclipse (helios) software to enable android in the device(prefered).
Step 3: Install Tomcat version 7.0 (to connect both front end and back end).
Step 4: Start tomcat.
Step 5: Android codings are executed by the option "Run as Android Application".

8. Usage (add instruction on how to use the app, or you can redirect to
External link if you have one):-we can use this application for areas which need high security and also it can be implemented for bank security.
